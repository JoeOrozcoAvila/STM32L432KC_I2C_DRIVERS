PROGRAM STATUS REGISTER (PSR): Is a combination of three special registers: Application program Status Register (APSR), Interrupt Program Status Register (IPSR)
and the Execution Program Status Register (EPSR)

Five status flags:

N: Negative Flag: Is set if the result of the ALU is negative, otherwise is cleared
Z: Zero Flag: Is set if the result of the ALU is zero, otherwise is cleared
V: Overflow Flag: Is set if an overflow takes place when performing a signed addition or substraction, otherwise is cleared
C: Carry Flag: Is set if carry occurs in unsigned addition and cleared otherwise.
			   For unsigned substraction, it is set if no borrow has occurred and is cleared otherwise
Q: Saturation Flag: Is set if an SSAT or USAT instruction causes saturation
   (Saturation instructions limit a given input to a configurable signed or unsigned range. When the input value exceeds the specified range, its output is then set as the maximum
   or minimum value of the selected range. Otherwise the output is equal to the input.)
   SSAT r2, #11, r1		; output range: -2^10 <= r2 <= 2^10
   USAT r2, #11, r1		;output range: 0 <= r2 <= 2^11
   
   
   int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int i;
    
    //1.- iterate over array of args
    for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++)
    {
        printf("argv %d is %s\n", i, argv[i]); //prints argv at index i
    }
    
    printf("\n\n");
    
    //2.- dereference each string arg(*argv) via to the pointer
    // to the start of each array of args (**argv)
    for (int i=0; i< argc; i++)
    {
        printf("arg %d is %s\n", i, *argv);
        argv += 1;
        
    }
    
    
    return 0;
}
